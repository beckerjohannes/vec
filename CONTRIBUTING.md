Under the umbrella of the prostep ivip Association, the continous development and improvement process of the standards takes place in two working groups, the VES-WF and the ECAD-IF. 

A more detailed description of the group activities can be found on the [prostep ivip website](https://www.prostep.org/en/projects/ves/ecad-project-groups). If you want to join, please reach out to the contact person listed the page.

## Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. 

**You found a bug, have a feature request or a question in the specifications?** 

Continuous development and improvement is crucial, also for standards. An essential factor to achieve this, is feedback from the user and implementer commmunity. Therefore, if you find a bug or an error in the recommendations, the schemas or 
any of the provided documentation of the standards, please do not hesitate to drop us an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/prostep-ivip-e-V/vec/issues). The same applies to all kinds of feature requests and questions.
