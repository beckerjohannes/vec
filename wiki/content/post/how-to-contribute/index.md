## Do you want to participate actively?

Under the umbrella of the prostep ivip Association, the continous development and improvement process of the standards takes place in two project groups, the VES-WF and the ECAD-IF. A more detailed description of the group activities can be found here: [VES-WF](https://www.prostep.org/en/projects/pdm-for-vehicle-electric-systems-pdm4ves/) / [ECAD-IF](https://www.prostep.org/en/projects/ecad-implementor-forum/).

If you want to join, please reach out to the contact person listed on the corresponding page.

## You found a bug, have a feature request or a question in the specifications?

Continuous development and improvement is crucial, also for standards. An essential factor to achieve this, is feedback from the user and implementer commmunity. Therefore: 

**If you find a bug or an error in the recommendations, the schemas or 
any of the provided documentation of the standards, please do not hesitate to drop us an issue in our [issue tracking system](https://track.prostep.com/projects/KBLFRM/). The same applies to all kinds of feature requests and questions.**

The issue management is done in a JIRA instance provided by prostep ivip. To request access, please send a request to Dr. Max Ungerer (*max.ungerer(at)prostep.com*)

## You want to contribute content directly to the ECAD-WIKI?
{{% alert note %}}
Since the specifications (KBL & VEC) are subject to a strict issue and publishing process, the following only applies to content beyond that (e.g. Implementation Guidelines & Sample Files).

*Every contribution counts!*. You can provide your own contribution to the content of the ECAD-WIKI when:

- You find errors, typos or other room for improvement in the existing documents,
- You want to contribute a proposal for an implementation guideline, or
- You have done a review for one the sample files, and to provide your findings

then you are more then welcome. All you need is a *GitLab.com* account, and that is what you need to know:
- The ECAD-WIKI is generated with the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 
- All content pages are stricly written in markdown and managed in our GitLab.com project [ECAD-WIKI](https://gitlab.com/ecad-wiki/ecad-wiki.gitlab.io)
- All pages have a "Edit this page" link on the left bottom. If you click this link, you are brought to GitLab's markdown online editor for this page.
- If you are not an active member of the project, you have to fork the project and then create a merge request with your changes. No worries, these are just two clicks in the web interface. More details in the [GitLab.com Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html)
- After your first contribution, you can request `Developer` access to the project, which makes the "forking" unnecessary.
- If you have a contribution (a feature request is also a contribution), but can not provide merge request you can drop us an issue on [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/ecad-wiki/ecad-wiki.gitlab.io/-/issues). 

{{% alert note %}}
This is only valid for features of the Wiki itself and content as specified above. Issues and merge requests concerning the specifications itsself will be closed without further comment.
