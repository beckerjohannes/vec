In 2024, the VEC Day will take place in a new setting and at a new location. In cooperation with the prostep ivip association, ARENA2036 is organising ‘Bordnetze Digital - The Digitalisation Congress for Wiring Systems Development and Production / VEC Day’ for the first time this year. The aim of this new format is to create a platform for exchange and discussion on the digitalisation of wiring system development and production processes as an annual event.

Information networking and data consistency are the basis for leveraging the potential of digitalisation and automation. This applies equally to the processes of wiring system development itself as well as the transition to production, e.g. to enable automated production.

There are various initiatives in this area, such as the Industrial Cloud in general, the Asset Administration Shell, Catena-X and Manufacturing-X, as well as the Vehicle Electric Container (VEC) as an end-to-end model of the vehicle electrical system. They create the prerequisites, foundations and framework conditions for new solutions and innovations.
