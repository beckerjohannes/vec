Despite the Corona Lockdown we were very active in the last weeks. The results of this work are now 
becoming visible step by step. After we already launched the ECAD Wiki in a completely new look 
a few weeks ago, we can now proudly announce that the VEC 1.2.0 is publicly available. This is the 
next major step towards a consistent and complete model of the physical network of 
vehicles and the associated data. 

The model description and the release notes can be found [here]({{< ref "specifications/vec/v120" >}}). 
The official recommendation documents will be linked there as soon as they become available.
