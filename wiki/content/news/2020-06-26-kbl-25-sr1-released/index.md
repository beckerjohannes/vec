We just released the first service release for KBL Version 2.5.

This release just contains some bug fixes and a minor feature improvement.
Please refer to the model description and the release notes, which can be found
[here]({{< ref "specifications/kbl/v25-sr1" >}}). As this is just a service
release, there will be no update / republication of the recommendation document.

Additionally we published some new implementation guidelines, specifically for
the KBL which can be found [here]({{< ref "specifications/kbl/guidelines" >}}).
