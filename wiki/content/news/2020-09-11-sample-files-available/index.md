We have added a new section [Sample Files]({{< ref "sample">}}) to the ECAD-WIKI and migrated the sample files which have already been available in the old ECAD-WIKI.

We are currently working on making more sample data available in WIKI.  You can help us with this. If you have sample data of a VEC or KBL implementation that can be made publicly available, we would be happy if you would provide us with it. For more information please see our [contribution guidelines]({{< ref "post/how-to-contribute" >}}).
