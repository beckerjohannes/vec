Today we are proud to announce public availability of VEC 2.0.0. This is the 
next major step towards a consistent and complete model of the physical network of 
vehicles and the associated data. 

With this version the VEC switched to a [semantic versioning scheme]({{< ref "specifications/vec/publication-process" >}}). As this version contains schema incompatible changes it is published as a new major version. A new recommendation is not published at this point. This version addresses about 60 Bugs and Features Requests. 

The issues that were resolved came mainly from two areas:

1. Direct feedback from implementation projects, and 
2. Requirements from the [ARENA 2036 IILS / DIN 72036](https://www.arena2036.de/en/innovation-initiative-wire-harness). 

More details, the model description and the release notes can be found [here]({{< ref "specifications/vec/v200" >}}).
