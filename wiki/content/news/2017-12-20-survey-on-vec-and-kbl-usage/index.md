The ECAD Implementor Forum would like to gain an overview of the products that support VEC and KBL. An online survey was started for this purpose. 
The answering of the questionnaire is intended to determine which functionalities are supported for exporting and importing KBL or VEC files.

Prostep ivip asks all system vendors that offer VEC or KBL interfaces or plan in the future to participate in the survey. The time needed is no more than 30 minutes. 
The online survey can be accessed at https://www.survio.com/survey/d/E6E8M7Q2B8G3V9T0A. 

Participation is possible until 28.02.2018.

As fill in assistance, you can find a PDF version of the survey structure and questions [here](prostepivip-survey-vec-kbl-usage.pdf). Please do not use this PDF to return your responses to us. We can accept only surveys completed online.
