A single fuse is a two-terminal component that can be plugged or screwed into a compatible fuse slot. There are different types, which differ in their geometry, the type of connection, the tripping characteristics and their rated voltage.

In VEC a fuse is handled as a EE-Component and that is why the  {{< vec-class FuseSpecification >}} extends the {{< vec-class "EEComponentSpecification" >}} and describes it's the available connector interface also with a *HousingComponent* and - in this case - with two *PinComponents*. The *FuseSpecification* defines the typical component attributes, i.e. the maximum electric currentÂ information for the fuse.

In addition to that the geometrical structure is described by a *ConnectorHousingSpecification* with it's *Slots* and their *Cavities*. The PinComponents can be described in a more detailed way by usage of the *PinComponentBehaviour*. Special information about the signal, signal direction or voltage can be placed here.

The *PinComponent* can reference a *TerminalSpecification* to define the physical properties of the pin. To avoid the confusion by too many crossing lines, the connection t the TermnalSpecification is not explicitly drawn in the diagram above.

## Instantiating fuses 

Instantiating fuses is like instantiating any other EE-Component. A EEComponentRole under a PartOccurrence references the FuseSpecification and all structure elements underneath will be instantiated and references their corresponding part master element, too. For more information see [E/E-Components]({{< relref "ee-components" >}}).
