{{% callout warning %}}
This is a **Release Candidate** Version for review only. If any bugs are found, this version can change at any time (even in a schema incompatible way).
{{% /callout %}}

With this version the VEC switched to a [semantic versioning scheme]({{< relref "../publication-process/" >}}). As this version contains schema incompatible changes it is published as a new major version. A new recommendation is not published at this point. This version addresses about 60 Bugs and Features Requests. To avoid dialects and to improve the semantic sharpness of the VEC, open enumerations have been defined for a large number of string attributes.
