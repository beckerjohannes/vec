<p> This section covers the general definition of a topology, the definition geometric views of that topology, placement of <i>OccurrenceOrUsages </i>on a topology and other geometric aspects like dimensioning.&#160;      </p>      <p> All geometric coordinate systems used in the VEC are right-handed (Right-hand rule). This also means, the direction of the z-Axis is in the direction of the cross product (X-Axis x Y-Axis).&#160;      </p>
