## Overview
Changes that affect the resulting schema in an incompatible way are marked with a &quot;X&quot; in the last column. For more details on compatibility [see]({{< relref "#compatibility-to-preceding-versions" >}}).

| Change | Incompatibility |
| --- | --- |
| Reorganization of the Model Outline (Chapter 5) | |
| Added &quot;General Guidelines&quot; for requirements on VEC implementations that are not strictly related to the model structure (Chapter 4). | |
| Added model documentation to the generated XML Schema files. | |
| General orthogonal grouping concept to represent functional mappings and requirements (see AssignmentGroup) | |
| Added concept for the instantiation of topologies. | |
| Added concept for hierarchical topologies supporting multiple use case (e.g. better traceability between geometry and harness process, splice position optimization, layered segments with a defined inner structure, composite segments, â€¦) | |
| Added concept for assigning topologies to zones. | |
| Completely revised the interpretation of Net- &amp; ConnectionSpecification (Architectural Layer &amp; System Schematic) | X |
| Refactoring of the multi-core representation | X |
| Added support for FIT-Rates for components | |

| Added concept for integrated terminals and supplementary components in different contacting situations (e.g. wire fixations) | |
| Clarification that contact points are free of variance. | |
| Refactored attributes for compatibility definitions between terminals, plugs, cavities, seals and wires. | X |

## Compatibility to preceding versions

Version 1.2 is an extension of version 1.1. Model changes and extensions are guided by the fundamental principle of keeping already implemented concepts downward compatible as far as possible. However, this was not possible in all cases. 

Compatibility is defined in the context of this document as the possibility that XML documents created for version 1.1 are still (schema) valid version 1.2 documents. In that sense, incompatible changes will result in schema validation errors if the version 1.1 file uses the affected model elements. Such changes are listed in [above]({{< relref "#overview" >}}) explicitly.

Additionally, version 1.2 introduces a large amount of open enumerations. As this reduces the degree of freedom in the model it is very likely that version 1.1 VEC files will not validate against the 1.2 strict schema.

Other changes that might be interpreted as incompatible, even without producing schema validation errors, are all improved or clarified documentations, as it might occur that earlier interpretations are now explicitly invalid model interpretations.

All VEC implementations that currently use custom properties for elements that have now (introduced with this version) explicit concepts should be changed accordingly.
