<html>   <head>     </head>   <body>     <p> The content of this chapter describes the various aspects of PDM&#160;information contained in the VEC. PDM&#160;information is every information that is no actual content data, but all meta data about <i>ItemVersions</i> contained in the VEC.     </p>      <p> Since most of the PDM information (product data management relevant information) is in principle equally relevant for both, parts and documents, the VEC defines the abstract superclass <i>ItemVersion</i> as anchor for the definition of PDM information.      </p>    </body> </html>
